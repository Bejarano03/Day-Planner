# Day-Planner

## Task

I was given the task to complete a day planner for my client. It's a simple application meant to show their task in time blocks. It uses the moment attribute to check on the current time so that they can only input stuff based on their current time. 

## Process

I used bootstrap to create the main layout, such as inputing the timeblocks as columns and using the bootstrap attributes to create certain classes and styles so that they could meet the requirements. I also incorporated some javascript so that these items on the html could be called and used in functions. The functions ranged from getting their current time to letting them input or not input certain things into the timeblocks. 

## Contributions 

I want to thank everyone that helped me in making this possible. This includes my instructors and study group as well as my tutor. 

## Let me know

Let me know if there are any issues with my application and tell me if I need to fix anything specifically.
